# Ruby Basics Assessment - Newsletter

This assessment is designed to test your understanding of the basics of Ruby. It covers

- Ruby Syntax Basics
- Problem Solving and Debugging in Ruby
- Ruby Arrays, Hashes, and Enumerable methods

Read these instructions carefully. They describe the code you'll be working with and what you need to do.

At the bottom of this file is the rubric used to evaluate your submission. You do not need to get everything right. Focus on getting each piece of code to work rather than writing partial solutions to each

## Introduction

The program you are working with is a command line tool to help generate newsletters. The code isn't working right now - there are errors in the existing code, and there's some functionality that is missing. Your job is to fix the errors and add the functionality so that the newsletters are generated correctly.

## Instructions

Syntax error in one file - debug the syntax error
Logic error in one file - debug the logic error
Missing array functionality in file - add functionality
Missing hashes functionality in file - add functionality
Missing enumerables functionality in file - add functionality
Run code to test that it matches output specified by instructions
Run code to generate some output based on input - output should be submitted

## Rubric

### Ruby Syntax Basics

1. Invalid syntax, code does not execute.
2. Valid syntax, but does not correctly use conditional statements, looping constructs, methods, or load code from other files
3. Valid syntax. Use of conditional statements, looping constructs, methods, and code loading is incomplete or with some errors.
4. Valid syntax. Correct use of conditional statements, looping constructs, methods, and code loading. Code generates the right output when executed. Code may have some unclear variable names, comments, formatting, or non-idiomatic Ruby.
5. Valid syntax. Correct use of conditional statements, looping constructs, methods, and code loading. Code generates the right output when executed. Code uses clear variable names, comments, formatting, and idiomatic Ruby.

### Problem Solving and Debugging in Ruby

1. Did not fix syntax or logic errors
2. Fixed syntax errors but not logic errors
3. Fixed syntax errors and some logic errors
4. Fixed syntax and logic errors
5. Fixed syntax and logic errors confidently, and made the code more resilient

### Ruby Arrays, Hashes, and Enumerable methods

1. Incorrect syntax for array and hash manipulation and enumerable methods
2. Some correct syntax for array and hash manipulation and enumerable methods, but incorrect logic
3. Correct syntax and logic for array and hash manipulation, but not enumerable methods
4. Correct syntax and logic for array and hash manipulation and enumerable methods
5. Correct syntax and logic for array and hash manipulation and enumerable methods and appropriate selection of enumerable methods for given tasks
